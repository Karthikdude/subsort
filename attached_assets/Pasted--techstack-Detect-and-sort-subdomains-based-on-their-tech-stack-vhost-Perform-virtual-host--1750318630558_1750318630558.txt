--techstack → Detect and sort subdomains based on their tech stack.

--vhost → Perform virtual host-based detection and save accordingly.

--title → Fetch the <title> tag from each subdomain's page to identify panels or services.

--responsetime → Measure response times and sort subdomains based on latency.

--faviconhash → Generate favicon hashes to identify technologies or services (useful for Shodan-style recon).

--robots → Fetch and parse robots.txt and sitemap.xml for hidden/disallowed endpoints.

--js → Extract and download linked JavaScript files for analysis.

--auth → Detect presence of login portals or authentication-requiring endpoints.

--server → Extract the Server header and group subdomains based on the value.

--status → Fetch and sort subdomains by HTTP status codes (200, 403, 404, etc.).

--jsvuln → Identify outdated/vulnerable JavaScript libraries and their versions.

--loginpanels → Detect and list login portals and auth forms across all subdomains.

--jwt → Extract and decode JWT tokens from headers or responses and analyze for insecure configs.

--cname → Check CNAME records for possible subdomain takeover due to third-party misconfigs.

--iphistory → Check historical IP records to track infrastructure changes (via APIs or public datasets).

--httpmethods → Discover supported HTTP methods like OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE to find misconfigurations.

--port → Perform port scanning (using Nmap or RustScan) and group based on open ports.

--ssl → Collect SSL certificate details (expiry, CN, issuer) and sort accordingly.

--headers → Analyze and store security-related headers like CSP, HSTS, etc.

--content → Sort based on Content-Type (text/html, application/json, etc.).

--cors → Detect CORS configuration issues or wildcards.

--cdn → Identify and group based on CDN or hosting provider (Cloudflare, AWS, etc.).

--length → Sort subdomains based on Content-Length or response similarity (using Simhash).

--geoip → Sort based on country, ASN, or IP origin.

--cms → Detect CMS (e.g., WordPress, Joomla) and organize results.

--httpmethods → Discover supported HTTP methods (e.g., OPTIONS, PUT) to check for misconfigurations.

--waf → Detect WAF and categorize accordingly (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai).

--cloudassets → Discover exposed S3 buckets, Azure blobs, or Google Cloud storage from subdomain content.

--dirscan → Discover common endpoints/directories (/admin, /api, etc.).

--wappalyzer → Use Wappalyzer or WhatWeb to identify frontend/backend technologies.

--vulnscan → Run vulnerability fingerprints using Nuclei or custom signatures.All outputs should be in .txt format by default (optionally .json if needed later).
